## ALL

	Decide on folding problem and benchmark --> Design(Moritz)
	Setup Infrastructure (AutoML, Pipelines)
	# Decide on Optimization Framework ( Skopt, AutoSklearn )
	Decide on AutoML Tools (BayesianOpt(Gaussian, RandomForests)), Ensembles
	# Get expert parametrization, intermediate, and "Random" for reference.
	training problem reduction? --> erst grob dann granular
	Decide on Optimizer, Bayesian Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes, Random Forrest.
	Successive Halfing ? 
	AquisitionFunction:
			probably RandomForests as they deal best with conditionals and mixed type input spaces. [on/off, continuous etc.]
	Feature Extraction for mapping of problem Characteristics to Function Weights.
  dummy_optimize for grid search
	How does the "new Function" for memebrain proteins etc can be handled. and can we learn from the information gained on ref15
	write generic wrapper around optimization so that everyone can throw in his/her project for energy function optimization.

## Problems
Sinnvoller Loss bei Design
## papers to read
perfect weights -- Kuhlmann, Baker 2000


## Notes
- Use Ref15 as default params.
- The Rotamer Packing only linnear scale up to 4 Threads.
- use FastDesign instead of moritz script for parallel.
- Relaxing is the notion of alowing the sequence to wiggle into its most likely 
native position begining with the chrystal structure, which is of course only
a snapshot that might not be ideal.


## Parallelization
N * 128 random runs --> save to file.
x0 and y0 in Optimizer. 

Use genetic algorithm for many parallel runs in the beginning. and only BO for the fine tuning 


# TODO
Implement Parallelization for warm-start
Research ensembles/genetic algorithms for optimization
Formulate Hypothesis ""
