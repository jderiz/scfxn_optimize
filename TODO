## ALL
	!!! Optimize the Folding Function !!!


	Decide on folding problem and benchmark --> Design(Moritz)
	Setup Infrastructure (AutoML, Pipelines)
	Decide on Optimization Framework ( Skopt, AutoSklearn )
	Decide on AutoML Tools (BayesianOpt(Gaussian, RandomForests)), Ensembles
	Formulate Hypothesis ""
	# Get expert parametrization, intermediate, and "Random" for reference.
	training problem reduction? --> erst grob dann granular
	Decide on Optimizer, Bayesian Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes, Random Forrest.
	Successive Halfing ? 
	AquisitionFunction:
			probably RandomForests as they deal best with conditionals and mixed type input spaces. [on/off, continuous etc.]
	Feature Extraction for mapping of problem Characteristics to Function Weights.
  dummy_optimize for grid search
	How does the "new Function" for memebrain proteins etc can be handled. and can we learn from the information gained on ref15
	write generic wrapper around optimization so that everyone can throw in his/her project for energy function optimization.

## Problems
