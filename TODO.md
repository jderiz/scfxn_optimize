# Thema Masterarbeit
    + Energy Function
    + ML Model structure stable yes/no
    + Can there be any gradient based method ? levinstein

# TODO: 
## Code
     - add time component to loss
     - add cooldown of xi and kappa
     - add SEED f√ºr replizierbarkeit
## Analysis
     - show Convergence of Optimization on each loss.
     - Determine 'best' configuration

## Ideas
    - PSO for guiding Monte Carlo
    - Quantum Algo for light vs conductor based.

## Problems
Sinnvoller Loss bei Design
Vergleich von Resultaten
## papers to read


## Notes
    - Use Ref15 as default params.
    - The Rotamer Packing only linnear scale up to 4 Threads.

# Clustering of results
normalize weight ranges then cluster results by configs and see if there is any significant 
improvement off result metrices in a particular cluster. 
then from the other side aggregate by metrices and check if there is something significant in the best perfoming configurations.
